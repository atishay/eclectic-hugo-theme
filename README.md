* `Site.Params.Guitar` - guitar2svg hosted location.
* `Site.Params.scss` - Set this to true if using Hugo extended - the scss version is pre-compiled as main.css to support non-extended Hugo version. This is to allow new developers on Hugo to non get stuck with the extended requirement. Enable if looking for CSS bugs.

## Browsers

* This theme uses all modern CSS like CSS Variables, CSS Grid and Flexbox. Do not expect this to support older browsers.

## Posts

* Use Hugo Page Bundles for posts. The theme automatically picks up `cover.jpg` in the page bundle as the cover image.

## Top Matter

* `sidebar` - You can add stuff to the page sidebar by using a the front matter and passing a list to `sidebar` with `title` and `content` properties. `content` can be markdown.
* `coverAnchor` - Add anchoring position for the cover image.

## Shortcodes

* `fig` Same as `figure`, but added support for providing image size.
* `guitar` Renders guitar tabs and chords using jtab. Needs `Site.Params.Guitar` for the `guitar2svg` hosting.
